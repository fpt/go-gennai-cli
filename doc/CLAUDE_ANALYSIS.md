This document analyzes Claude Code's behavior based on session logs to identify missing features in gennai and create a roadmap for achieving feature parity.

## Analysis Summary

**Log File Analyzed:** `878fdbcb-d4d8-4e6a-91ad-439272620dc5.jsonl` (2.8MB, 252 tool uses)  
**Session Context:** Development work on go-llama-code project with ReAct architecture improvements  
**Tool Usage Pattern:** Heavy emphasis on file editing, task management, and systematic problem solving

## Core Tool Usage Statistics

| Tool Name | Usage Count | Percentage | Purpose |

| `Edit` | 96 | 38.1% | Advanced file editing with precise string replacement |
| `Bash` | 74 | 29.4% | Shell command execution, builds, tests |
| `Read` | 40 | 15.9% | File content examination |
| `Write` | 18 | 7.1% | New file creation |
| `Grep` | 9 | 3.6% | Content search across files |
| `TodoWrite` | 6 | 2.4% | Task management and progress tracking |
| MCP Tools | 9 | 3.6% | GitHub integration, documentation |

## Critical Missing Features in gennai

### 1. Advanced Edit Tool (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Claude Code's Edit Tool:**
```json
{
  "name": "Edit",
  "input": {
    "file_path": "/absolute/path/to/file.go",
    "old_string": "exact multiline string to replace",
    "new_string": "precise replacement content"
  }
}
```

**Key Capabilities:**
- Exact string matching with multiline support
- Absolute file path specification
- Context-aware replacements
- Handles complex code refactoring

**Current gennai equivalent:** `edit_file` with basic `replace_from`/`replace_to`

**Gap:** gennai's edit tool is significantly less sophisticated

### 2. Task Management System (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Claude Code's TodoWrite:**
```json
{
  "name": "TodoWrite", 
  "input": {
    "todos": [
      {
        "content": "Investigate why tree_dir tool result shows 'Non-text content received'",
        "status": "in_progress",
        "priority": "high", 
        "id": "1"
      },
      {
        "content": "Fix MCP tool result handling for text-based tools",
        "status": "pending",
        "priority": "high",
        "id": "2"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Key Capabilities:**
- Multi-task tracking with IDs
- Status management (pending, in_progress, completed)
- Priority levels (high, medium, low)
- Progress persistence across sessions

**Current gennai equivalent:** None

**Gap:** No task management or progress tracking system

### 3. Enhanced Bash Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Claude Code's Bash Tool:**
- 74 total uses (29.4% of all tool calls)
- Sophisticated command execution with error handling
- Build system integration
- Git operations
- System-level interactions

**Common patterns observed:**
```bash
go test ./internal/config/ -v
go build ./gennai
git status
git commit -m "message"
```

**Current gennai equivalent:** Basic `go_build`, `go_run` tools

**Gap:** Limited shell command capabilities

### 4. Multi-Edit Operations (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Observed Pattern:** Claude Code often performs multiple related edits in sequence:
1. Import statement addition
2. Function implementation
3. Error handling updates
4. Test file updates

**Current gennai equivalent:** Single edit operations only

**Gap:** No batch editing or coordinated multi-file changes

### 5. Advanced MCP Tool Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Claude Code MCP Usage:**
- `mcp__godevmcp__search_github_code` (4 uses)
- `mcp__godevmcp__get_github_content` (3 uses)
- `mcp__godevmcp__tree_dir` (1 use)
- `mcp__godevmcp__read_godoc` (1 use)

**Key Observation:** MCP tools used strategically for research and code discovery

**Current gennai equivalent:** Basic MCP integration with limited tool usage

**Gap:** Under-utilized MCP capabilities

## Workflow Analysis

### Typical Claude Code Session Pattern:

1. **Problem Identification**
   - Uses `TodoWrite` to break down complex tasks
   - Sets priorities and tracks status

2. **Investigation Phase**
   - `Read` files to understand current state
   - `Grep` for specific patterns or issues
   - MCP tools for external research

3. **Implementation Phase**
   - Multiple `Edit` operations with precise string matching
   - `Bash` commands for testing and validation
   - `Write` for new file creation when needed

4. **Validation Phase**
   - `Bash` commands for builds and tests
   - `Read` to verify changes
   - `TodoWrite` to update task status

### gennai Current Pattern:

1. **Scenario Selection** → Single action type
2. **Tool Usage** → Limited to scenario-specific tools
3. **Response Generation** → Single response per invocation

**Gap:** gennai lacks the iterative, multi-step workflow management

## Technical Implementation Insights

### 1. Edit Tool Implementation Details

**Critical Features from Log Analysis:**
- Uses absolute paths: `/Users/youichi.fujimoto/Documents/scratch/go-llama-code/pkg/agent/domain/mcp.go`
- Handles complex multiline string replacements
- Preserves exact whitespace and formatting
- Supports large code block replacements

### 2. Error Handling Patterns

**Observed Claude Code Behavior:**
- Creates todo items when issues are discovered
- Updates task status as work progresses
- Uses systematic debugging approach
- Maintains context across multiple tool calls

### 3. Session Management

**Key Observations:**
- Maintains conversation context effectively
- References previous work and decisions
- Builds on prior tool results
- Tracks long-term project goals

## Recommended Implementation Roadmap

   - Reference prior work and decisions
   - Support project-level continuity

2. **Intelligent Tool Selection**
   - Learn from successful tool patterns
   - Optimize tool usage based on context
   - Improve scenario selection accuracy

## Success Metrics

1. **Tool Usage Distribution**
   - Target: Match Claude Code's tool usage patterns
   - Measure: Edit (40%), Bash (30%), Read (15%), Write (8%), TodoWrite (5%)

2. **Multi-Step Task Completion**
   - Target: Successfully break down and complete complex tasks
   - Measure: Task completion rate and user satisfaction

3. **Code Quality**
   - Target: Generate code changes comparable to Claude Code
   - Measure: Precision of edits, build success rate, test pass rate

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that gennai is currently operating at a much simpler level than Claude Code. The primary gaps are:

1. **Sophisticated editing capabilities** (Edit tool)
2. **Task management system** (TodoWrite)
3. **Advanced shell integration** (Bash tool)
4. **Multi-step workflow coordination**

Addressing these gaps systematically will bring gennai closer to Claude Code's capabilities and user experience.

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Phase 1 implementation
2. Implement Enhanced Edit Tool first (highest impact)
3. Add TodoWrite for task management
4. Upgrade to full Bash tool capabilities
5. Test each component against real-world scenarios
6. Iterate based on usage patterns and feedback
