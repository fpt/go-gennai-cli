I'm reviewing a project plan and suspect there might be circular dependencies in the task assignments. Can you help me analyze this and determine if it's feasible?

Problem: Analyze this project plan for circular dependencies:

Project Tasks:
- Design (depends on Review)
- Development (depends on Design)  
- Testing (depends on Development)
- Review (depends on Testing)

Task Dependencies (task A → task B means A must complete before B starts):
- Review → Design (Review must complete before Design can start)
- Design → Development (Design must complete before Development can start)
- Development → Testing (Development must complete before Testing can start)
- Testing → Review (Testing must complete before Review can start)

Questions:
- Are there any circular dependencies in this plan?
- If cycles exist, which tasks are involved in the circular dependency?
- Why would this project plan be problematic?
- How could any circular dependencies be resolved?

Expected result: Analysis of the dependency structure and identification of any circular relationships.
