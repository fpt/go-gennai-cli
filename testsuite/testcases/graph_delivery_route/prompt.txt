I'm a delivery driver and need to find the shortest route between locations. Can you help me optimize my delivery route?

Problem: Find the shortest path from Warehouse to Store through this delivery network:

Locations:
- Warehouse (starting point)
- Mall
- Hospital 
- Store (end point)

Road network with distances (in miles):
- Warehouse → Mall: 5 miles
- Warehouse → Hospital: 8 miles
- Mall → Hospital: 3 miles
- Mall → Store: 7 miles
- Hospital → Store: 4 miles

I need to:
- Find the optimal route from Warehouse to Store
- Know the total distance I'll travel
- Get the complete sequence of locations to visit

Expected result: The shortest path with total distance and the sequence of locations to visit.
