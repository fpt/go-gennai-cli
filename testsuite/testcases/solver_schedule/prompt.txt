I need to use the CSP solver tool to solve a constraint satisfaction problem. Please use the solve_csp tool for this scheduling optimization problem:

Problem: Schedule 4 people (Alice, Bob, Carol, David) to 4 time slots (9am, 10am, 11am, 12pm) with the following constraints:
- Each person gets exactly one time slot
- No two people can share the same time slot  
- Alice cannot be scheduled at 9am (she's not available)
- Bob must be scheduled before Carol (Bob's slot < Carol's slot)
- David must be scheduled at either 11am or 12pm

Requirements:
- Use the solve_csp tool to find a valid assignment
- Model this as variables A, B, C, D representing Alice, Bob, Carol, David
- Use domain [1,2,3,4] where 1=9am, 2=10am, 3=11am, 4=12pm
- Include all the constraints listed above
- Show the solution with both the numeric values and the time slot names
- Explain why the solution satisfies all constraints

Expected result: A valid schedule that assigns each person to a unique time slot while satisfying all constraints.
