I need help solving a scheduling optimization problem. Can you help me schedule people to time slots with specific constraints?

Problem: Schedule 4 people (Alice, Bob, Carol, David) to 4 time slots (9am, 10am, 11am, 12pm) with the following constraints:
- Each person gets exactly one time slot
- No two people can share the same time slot  
- Alice cannot be scheduled at 9am (she's not available)
- Bob must be scheduled before Carol (Bob's slot < Carol's slot)
- David must be scheduled at either 11am or 12pm

I need to:
- Find a valid assignment that satisfies all constraints
- See the solution with both numeric values and time slot names
- Understand why the solution satisfies all constraints

Expected result: A valid schedule that assigns each person to a unique time slot while satisfying all constraints.
