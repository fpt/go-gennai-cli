I'm planning to cook and need help deciding what raw ingredients to buy. I have a budget of $25 and want to buy exactly 3 items from these options:

- Ground beef ($12 per package)
- Rice ($4 per bag) 
- Tomatoes ($6 per basket)
- Onions ($3 per bag)

My constraints are:
- I must buy at least one protein (ground beef)
- The total cost must be exactly $19 (I want to save $6 from my $25 budget)
- I need exactly 3 different items

Can you help me figure out what combination of items I should buy? Please provide your final answer as a clear shopping list format like:

**Shopping List:**
- Item 1 ($price)
- Item 2 ($price)
- Item 3 ($price)
**Total: $19**
