This is an interesting resource allocation problem! Let me model this as a constraint satisfaction problem.

I'll represent each item as a variable that can be either 0 (not bought) or 1 (bought):
- Variables: GroundBeef, Rice, Tomatoes, Onions
- Domain: [0, 1] for each item (0 = don't buy, 1 = buy)
- Constraints:
  1. GroundBeef >= 1 (must buy the protein)
  2. 12*GroundBeef + 4*Rice + 6*Tomatoes + 3*Onions = 19 (total cost exactly $19)
  3. GroundBeef + Rice + Tomatoes + Onions = 3 (exactly 3 items)

Let me use the CSP solver to find a valid shopping combination:

[Tool call to solve_csp with variables representing each item as 0/1 and constraints for the budget and requirements]

Based on the solution, you should buy:
- Ground beef ($12) ✓
- Rice ($4) ✓  
- Onions ($3) ✓

Total cost: $12 + $4 + $3 = $19 ✓

This satisfies all your constraints:
✓ Has the required protein (ground beef)
✓ Total cost is exactly $19
✓ Exactly 3 different items
✓ Stays within your $25 budget with $6 saved
