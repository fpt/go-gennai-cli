I need you to perform a multi-step refactoring of the provided Go code. Execute these changes in separate, isolated steps:

**STEP 1**: Change the User ID field from `int` to `string` type
- Update the User struct field type
- Update ALL functions that use ID parameters (AddUser, GetUser, UpdateUserAge)
- Update error messages to work with string IDs (change %d to %s)
- Update the main() function to use string IDs instead of int IDs
- Ensure code compiles and runs correctly after this step

----

**STEP 2**: Refactor `UpdateUserAge` to be a method on User struct
- Remove the `UpdateUserAge` method from UserService
- Add an `UpdateAge(newAge int)` method to the User struct
- Update ALL calls from `service.UpdateUserAge(id, age)` to `user.UpdateAge(age)`
- The method should update the user's age directly since it's called on the user instance
- Ensure code compiles and runs correctly after this step

This tests your ability to plan and execute changes in isolated, sequential steps while maintaining code integrity at each stage.
