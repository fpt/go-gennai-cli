I'm setting up a simple build pipeline and need to determine the correct order for building components. Can you help me figure out the build sequence?

Problem: Determine the build order for these 4 components:

Components:
- Database (no dependencies)
- Library (depends on Database)
- Service (depends on Library) 
- Tests (depends on Service)

Dependencies (component A → component B means A must be built before B):
- Database → Library
- Library → Service
- Service → Tests

I need to:
- Determine the correct build order
- Verify that no circular dependencies exist
- Get the complete build sequence

Expected result: A valid build order that respects all component dependencies.
