I'm managing a simple project and need to determine the task sequence. Can you help me create a project timeline?

Problem: Plan the execution order for these 4 project tasks:

Project Tasks:
- Plan (no dependencies - starting task)
- Design (depends on Plan)
- Build (depends on Design)
- Test (depends on Build)

Task Dependencies (task A → task B means A must complete before B starts):
- Plan → Design
- Design → Build  
- Build → Test

I need to:
- Determine the correct task execution order
- Ensure all task dependencies are satisfied
- Verify there are no circular dependencies
- Get the complete task sequence

Expected result: A valid task execution order that respects all project dependencies.
