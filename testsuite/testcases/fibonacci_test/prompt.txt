Create a complete Go program that generates and prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.

Requirements:
- Create exactly ONE file named "main.go"
- Include proper package main and main() function
- Implement the Fibonacci sequence algorithm (each number is sum of the two preceding ones)
- Generate and print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers using the algorithm
- Output the numbers separated by spaces on a single line
- Do NOT create additional files like go.mod, go.sum, or test files
- Do NOT run go mod init or other module commands
- Focus only on creating the single main.go file

Expected result: A single file "main.go" that calculates and prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers

----
Second task: Modify the program to accept a command line argument for the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.

Requirements:
- Modify the existing main.go file (do NOT create new files)
- Use os.Args to read command line arguments
- If no argument is provided, default to 10 numbers
- If an argument is provided, use that number (handle invalid input gracefully)
- Do NOT create additional files or run module commands
- You can run with `go run main.go` command but only once

Expected result: The same main.go file that can accept a command line argument for count.
