Create a simple Go function that adds two integers and returns the result.

Requirements:
- Create exactly ONE file named "add.go"
- The file should contain a function named "add" that takes two int parameters and returns their sum
- Include proper package declaration (package main)
- Include a main() function for testing the add function
- Do NOT create additional files like go.mod, go.sum, or test files
- Do NOT run go mod init or other module commands
- Focus only on creating the single add.go file with both the add function and main function

Expected result: A single file "add.go" containing both the add function and a main function that demonstrates its usage.
